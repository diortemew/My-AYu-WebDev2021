This repository exists due to a Udemy Course I purchased so that I could delve into Web Development via Angela Yu's "The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp". For the most part I've been keeping my files on a friend's git server, but thought I'd share here, too in case others want to refer to the code I write to help them learn any sections or elements that they may struggle with or not understand. This will also help me become more familiar with git and GitHub as I take on all of these new technologies.

I am a Metroid fanatic with a passion for most things Nintendo including their IPs such as Mario, Zelda, Kirby, and Donkey Kong. Also, I am United States Air Force Veteran disabled after a 15-year career. After my separation I focused on Linux Admin and peered into Python; I earned my AAS, Information Technology a couple of years ago and have recently discovered a geeky desire to develop on the front-end of web development. I also love to read about Free and Open-source Software (FOSS), FreeBSD, Linux, and the latest updates on cyber security fundamentals.

I have a lot to learn, so if you find yourself in need of code for Ms. Yu's coding bootcamp, stop by, but do yourself a favor; follow along, pause the videos when she challenges you, and no matter what, do not give up. Stick with it. May the Force be with you. Cheers!
